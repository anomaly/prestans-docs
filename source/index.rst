prestans, a Python REST micro-framework
=======================================

prestans is a WSGI (PEP-333) complaint micro-framework that allows you to rapidly build quality REST services by introducing a pattern of models, parsers and handlers and in turn taking care of boilerplate code. prestans is currently hosted on `Google Code <http://prestans.googlecode.com>`_ and distributed under the terms defined by the `New BSD license <http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php>`_.
