prestans, a Python WSGI REST micro-framework
=======================================

.. warning:: This branch of the documentation is under agressive development along with the framework.

prestans is a WSGI (`PEP-333 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/>`_) complaint micro-framework that allows you to rapidly build quality REST services by introducing a pattern of models, parsers and handlers and in turn taking care of boilerplate code. prestans sits better with complex Ajax applications written with JavaScript infrastructure like `Google Closure <https://developers.google.com/closure/>`_, or native mobile apps.

prestans is currently hosted on `Github <http://github.com/prestans>`_ and distributed under the terms defined by the `New BSD license <http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php>`_. A list of current downloads is `available here <https://github.com/prestans/prestans/tags>`_.  We highly recommend using `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org>`_ to install prestans.

Getting Help
------------

We encourge the use of our mailing lists (run on Google Groups) as the primary method of getting help. You can also write the developers through contact information `our website <http://etk.com.au>`_.

* `Discuss <http://groups.google.com/group/prestans-discuss>`_ general discussion, help, suggest a new feature.
* `Announcements <http://groups.google.com/group/prestans-announce>`_ security / release announcements.

Reporting Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We prefer the use of our `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/prestans/prestans/issues>`_ on Github, to triage feature requests, bug reports. Code patches are very welcome.

Before you lodge a lodge a ticket:

* Ensure that you ask a question on our list, there might already be answer out there or we might have already acknowledged the issue
* Seek wisdom from our beautifully written documentation 
* Google to see that it's not something to do with your server environment (versions of Web server, WSGI connectors, etc)
* Check to ensure that you are *not* lodging a duplicate request.

When reporting issues:

* Include as much detail as you can about your environment (e.g Server OS, Web Server and it's Version, WSGI connector)
* Steps that we can use to replicate the bug
* Share a bit of your application code with us, it goes a long way to replicate issues
