Prestans 2.0, a Python WSGI REST micro-framework
================================================

Prestans is a WSGI (`PEP-333 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/>`_) complaint micro-framework that allows you to rapidly build quality REST services by introducing a pattern of models, parsers and handlers and in turn taking care of boilerplate code. Prestans sits better with complex Ajax applications written with JavaScript infrastructure like `Google Closure <https://developers.google.com/closure/>`_, or native mobile apps.

Prestans is currently hosted on `Github <http://github.com/Prestans>`_ and distributed under the terms defined by the `New BSD license <http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php>`_. A list of current downloads is `available here <https://github.com/Prestans/Prestans/tags>`_.  We highly recommend using `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org>`_ to install Prestans.

This document assumes that you have a working knowledge of REST and WSGI.

Reporting Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We prefer the use of our `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/Prestans/Prestans/issues>`_ on Github, to triage feature requests, bug reports. Code patches are very welcome.

Before you lodge a lodge a ticket:

* Ensure that you ask a question on our list, there might already be answer out there or we might have already acknowledged the issue
* Seek wisdom from our beautifully written documentation 
* Google to see that it's not something to do with your server environment (versions of Web server, WSGI connectors, etc)
* Check to ensure that you are *not* lodging a duplicate request.

When reporting issues:

* Include as much detail as you can about your environment (e.g Server OS, Web Server and it's Version, WSGI connector)
* Steps that we can use to replicate the bug
* Share a bit of your application code with us, it goes a long way to replicate issues
