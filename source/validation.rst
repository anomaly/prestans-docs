Validating Requests & Responses
===============================

A robust and secure API is responsible for validating all incoming and outgoing data to ensure that it matches business rules. Validation is at the heart of prestans design and a cornerstone feature. 

APIs have three major areas where data validation is paramount:

* Query String parameters supplied to the API as key value pairs in the URL ``http://localhost/api/album?offset=10&limit=20``
* Serialized data in the body of the request, which is unpacked and made available for use to the handler
* Data that's serialized down to the client as the response to each request. This is typically but not necessarily read back from persistent data stores.

prestans allows each request handler to elegantly define the rules it wants to adhere to by declaring what we refer to as a ``VerbConfig`` (the Verb refers to the HTTP verb). 

Setting up validation rules
---------------------------

Validation rules are set up per HTTP verb your handler intends to service. By default there are no validation rules defined for any HTTP verb, this does not mean that your handler can't respond to a particular verb, it simply means that prestans takes no responsibility of validating incoming or outgoing data. By design if you wish to send data back to the client prestans insist on validating what a handler sends down, however it's perfectly valid for a handler to return no content (which is what prestans expects if you aren't specific).

Each handler has a meta attribute called __verb_config__ this must be an instance of ``prestans.parser.Config`` which accepts six named parameters one for each supported HTTP verb (``HEAD``, ``GET``, ``POST``, ``PUT``, ``DELETE``, ``PATCH``) each one of which must be an instance of ``prestans.parser.VerbConfig``. A ``VerbConfig`` accepts the following named parameters (not all of them are supported across all HTTP verbs):

* ``response_template`` an instance of a ``prestans.types.DataCollection`` subclass i.e a Model or an Array of prestans ``DataType``. This is what prestans will use to validate the response your handler sends back to the client.
* ``response_attribute_filter_default_value`` prestans automatically creates an attribute filter based on the ``response_template`` by default prestans exposes all it's attributes in the response, setting this to ``False`` will hide all attributes be default. Your handler code is responsible for toggling visibility in either instance.
* ``parameter_sets`` an array of ``prestans.parser.ParameterSet`` instances
* ``body_template`` an instance of a ``prestans.types.DataCollection`` subclass i.e a Model or an Array of prestans ``DataType``, this is what prestans will use to validate the request sent to your handler. If validation of the incoming data fails, prestans will not execute the associated verb in your handler.
* ``request_attribute_filter`` is an attribute filter used to relax or tighten rules for the incoming data. This is particularly useful if you want to use portions of a model. Particularly useful for ``UPDATE`` requests.

.. code-block:: python

    import prestans.rest
    import prestans.parser

    import musicdb.rest.models


    class CollectionRequestHandler(prestans.rest.RequestHandler):

        __verb_config__ = prestans.parser.Config(
            GET =  prestans.parser.VerbConfig(
                body_template=prestans.types.Array(element_template=musicdb.rest.models.Album())
            ),            
            POST =  prestans.parser.VerbConfig(
                body_template=musicdb.rest.models.Album()
            )            
        )

        def get(self):
            ... do stuff here

        def post(self):
            ... do stuff here

prestans is aggressive when it comes to validating requests and responses. However in the cases where you wish to relax the rules we recommend that you use 

.. code-block:: python

    update_filter = prestans.parser.AttributeFitler(model_instance=musicdb.prest.models.Album(), default_value=False)
    update_filter.name = True

    class EntityRequestHandler(prestans.rest.RequestHandler):

        __verb_config__ = prestans.parser.Config( 
            GET = prestans.parser.VerbConfig(
                response_template=musicdb.rest.models.Album(),
                response_attribute_filter_default_value=False,
                parameters_sets=[]
            ),
            PUT =  prestans.parser.VerbConfig(
                body_template=musicdb.rest.models.Album(),
                request_attribute_fitler=update_filter
            )
        )

        def get(self, album_id):
            ... do stuff here

        def put(self, album_id):
            ... do stuff here

        def delete(self, album_id):
            ... do stuff here
