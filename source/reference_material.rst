Reference Material
==================

We found the following references useful while writing prestans, they cover a variety of advanced Python programming and Web development topics.

It's important that you understand the basic concepts of Python Web Programming. All our documentation and support is based around the assumption that you are familiar with Python Web development using `WSGI <http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ and are writing Ajax Web apps.

WSGI
====

* `WSGI <http://www.wsgi.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ the way Web servers talk to Python apps.
* `ReUsable Web Components with Python and Future Python Web <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-mSFuUZmQ>`_ presented by Ben Bangert (YouTube).

Advanced Python
===============

* `Python Decorators <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/>`_ various prestans utilities are provided as decorators
