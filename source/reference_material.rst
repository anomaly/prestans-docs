Reference Material
==================

We found the following references useful while writing prestans, they cover a variety of advanced Python programming and Web development topics.

It's important that you understand the basic concepts of Python Web Programming. All our documentation and support is based around the assumption that you are familiar with Python Web development using WSGI and are writing Ajax Web apps.

WSGI
====

* `WSGI <http://www.wsgi.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ the way Web servers talk to Python apps.
* `ReUsable Web Components with Python and Future Python Web <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-mSFuUZmQ>`_ presented by Ben Bangert (YouTube).
* `Hosting Python Web Applications <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWIvm-uloMg>`_ presented by Graham P Dumpleton, author of `mod_wsgi <http://modwsgi.googlecode.com>`_ (YouTube).

Advanced Python
===============

* `Python Decorators <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/>`_ various prestans utilities are provided as decorators
* `Python Types and Objects <http://www.cafepy.com/article/python_types_and_objects/python_types_and_objects.html>`_ an excellent article by Shalabh Chaturvedi on how Python sees Objects and Types.
* `Python Attributes and Methods <http://www.cafepy.com/article/python_attributes_and_methods/>`_ another excellent article by Shalabh Chaturvedi providing an indepth understanding of how attributes and methods work.
